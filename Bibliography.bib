We identify six classes of side information which can be imposed by semidefinite programming and that arise naturally in many applications. We demonstrate their value on two examples from epidemiology and physics. Some density results on polynomial dynamical systems that either exactly or approximately satisfy side information are also presented. } }

We propose a data-driven method for designing a distributed linear-quadratic controller where agents learn a non-parametric system model from a single sample trajectory in which nodes can predict future trajectories using only data available to themselves and their neighbors. Based on this system representation, we propose a control scheme where a network optimization problem is solved in a receding horizon manner. We show that the proposed control scheme is stabilizing and validate our results through numerical experiments.} }
